\begin{exercise}\label{bh18 extension}
	\textbf{[BH.18]} A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. First answer the original questions in your own words.\\~\\
	Extensions from this exercise:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item\label{bh18 extension a}  A fair coin is tossed repeatedly, until it has landed Heads at least once. Find the PMF of the number of total tosses performed.
		\item\label{bh18 extension b}  A fair coin is tossed repeatedly, until it has landed Heads at least once and has landed Tails at least once. Find the PMF of the number of total tosses performed.
		\item Can you verify your calculated expectation with the distribution derived from Ex \ref{bh18 extension}.\ref{bh18 extension b}. You can use the fact that $\sum_{k = 2}^\infty \frac{k}{2^{k-1}} =3$ (or you can use the following code to find the result of the sum numerialcally).
		\begin{minted}[]{R}
#Define the function
f <- function(x){ x/(2^(x-1))}

# First check on a segment
lower = 2
upper = 20
sum(f(seq(lower, upper, by=1)))

# # For upper boundary to be larger and larger 
lower = 2
upper = 2^10-1
sum(f(seq(lower, upper, by=1)))
		\end{minted}
	\end{enumerate}
