	\begin{enumerate}
		\item First answer the original questions in your own words.
	\end{enumerate}
Some extensions:
\begin{itemize}
%	\item What is the relation between $\P{B|A}$ and $\P{B^c|A}$, how about  $\P{B|A}$ and $\P{B|A^c}$?
	\item Can you prove that the conditional probability given event $A$ satisfies the non-naive definition of probability?
\end{itemize}
	\begin{hint}~\textit{Hint:}\\
		What happens if $A$ and $B$ are independent?
	\end{hint}
