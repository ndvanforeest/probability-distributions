\begin{exercise}
	\textbf{[BH.42]} $X$ be a random day of the week, and $Y$ is the next day after $X$. First answer the original questions in your own words.\\~\\
	Extensions from this exercise:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the distribution of $Z=Y-X$? 
	\item What is the distribution of $\tilde{Z}=1_{\{1\}}(Y-X)$? $1_{\{1\}}(x)=1$ if $x\in\{1\}$ (i.e.,$x=1$) otherwise 0.
	\item What is the distribution of $\tilde{\tilde{Z}}=\max\{1,\tilde{Z}\}$? Can you prove that $\tilde{\tilde{Z}}$ is independent from $X$?
\end{enumerate}
